# Specification Quality Checklist: Monorepo Framework for Web MMORPG Backend & Frontend

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-10
**Feature**: ./spec.md

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  
	- NOTE: Original user input mentioned specific stacks; spec rephrased outcomes generically except unavoidable references to session/log concepts (acceptable).
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs  
	- User stories center on developer onboarding, protocol consistency, secure sessions.
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders  
	- Avoids library names; explains outcomes plainly.
- [x] All mandatory sections completed  
	- User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Key Entities, Assumptions, Risks present.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain  
	- All prior markers resolved (grant strategy, concurrency target, persistence decision incorporated into spec).
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous  
	- Each FR states observable behavior; only those with clarification markers pending.
- [x] Success criteria are measurable  
	- SC-001..SC-007 include quantifiable thresholds (one pending numeric target once clarified).
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)  
	- No vendor / framework named; metrics phrased functionally.
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined  
	- Added failure scenario for protocol version mismatch in User Story 2.
- [x] Edge cases are identified  
	- List includes runtime mismatch, ports, token expiry, network interruption.
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded  
	- Out of Scope section enumerates exclusions.
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified  
	- Assumptions section plus clarifications list.

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria  
	- Clarified FR-020..FR-022 now specific and testable.
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows  
	- Core flows (bootstrap, shared types, auth) included.
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria  
	- SC-006 now concrete with 100-session target; all criteria measurable.
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification  
	- Tech names omitted in requirement statements.

## Notes

- All clarification questions resolved; checklist now fully green.
