# Feature Specification: Project Framework: Backend & Frontend Scaffold with Confidential Client Auth

**Feature Branch**: `001-we-need-a`  
**Created**: 2025-10-09  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need a project framework that will support the server backend and web app frontend. The framework should include the base folder structure to support both backend and frontend, and it should include the auth flow with the backend acting as a confidential client."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Initialize Unified Project Scaffold (Priority: P1)

A developer creates a new repository (or uses this one) and generates a standardized folder structure that cleanly separates backend domain logic, shared libraries, and web frontend assets while providing common configuration, environment handling, and documentation stubs. After scaffold generation, both backend server and frontend application can be started independently or together without manual restructuring.

**Why this priority**: Foundational—without the scaffold no other feature can proceed efficiently; it reduces setup time and enforces consistency.

**Independent Test**: Remove any existing custom code, apply the scaffold, then verify: (1) required top-level folders exist, (2) each contains placeholder README describing purpose, (3) running baseline start commands (one for backend, one for frontend) succeeds using only provided instructions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** an empty (or minimally initialized) repo, **When** the framework scaffolding is applied, **Then** the prescribed folder hierarchy is created with placeholder docs and configuration samples.
2. **Given** the scaffold exists, **When** a developer inspects directories, **Then** backend, frontend, shared, scripts, infra, and tests areas are clearly named and non-overlapping.

---

### User Story 2 - Implement Confidential Client Auth Flow Foundation (Priority: P2)

As a developer, I can rely on a standardized authentication abstraction where the backend acts as a confidential client (securely storing credentials/secrets) to obtain tokens and issue session context / frontend-compatible tokens so the web app never handles confidential secrets directly.

**Why this priority**: Security and access control are essential but come after having the scaffold to host the logic.

**Independent Test**: Configure mock or real identity provider credentials (without altering code structure) and verify: (1) backend can successfully obtain a protected token using stored secret material, (2) frontend receives only non-confidential tokens/session identifiers, (3) unauthorized access attempts are rejected with standardized responses.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** valid confidential client credentials, **When** the backend requests an access token, **Then** a token is obtained and stored transiently per best-practice lifetime rules.
2. **Given** frontend user context is not yet authenticated, **When** a protected API is called, **Then** the response indicates authentication required without leaking implementation details.
3. **Given** a valid user/session token issued via backend mediation, **When** accessing a protected endpoint, **Then** access is granted and audit info is recorded.

---

### User Story 3 - Extendable Module & Feature Addition Workflow (Priority: P3)

A developer adding a new domain feature (e.g., inventory, profile, dashboard) can create aligned backend module + matching frontend component(s) + shared types/documentation using a repeatable pattern (naming, placement, test layout) in under a defined time threshold without ambiguity.

**Why this priority**: Enhances long-term velocity once the scaffold and auth base exist.

**Independent Test**: Time a developer unfamiliar with the codebase creating a new feature module skeleton (backend endpoints + frontend view shell + tests) by following CONTRIBUTING / scaffolding docs; verify completion within target time and structure compliance via checklist.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:
1. **Given** the framework docs, **When** a developer runs the prescribed module creation steps, **Then** new directories, test stubs, and doc placeholders appear in standardized locations.
2. **Given** a newly added module, **When** lint/validation scripts (structure checker) run, **Then** no structural violations are reported.

---

### Edge Cases

- Missing or malformed environment variables during startup (framework must surface clear diagnostics and safe defaults where possible).
- Disabled or unreachable identity provider (backend should degrade gracefully: deny auth-required requests, expose health warning endpoint state).
- Token acquisition failure mid-request (should not leak sensitive error text; standardized error envelope returned).
- Expired/invalid/forged frontend token presented (must be rejected with consistent unauthorized response; no stack trace leakage).
- Simultaneous module creation by different developers causing naming collision (detection + guidance message).
- Frontend attempting to directly request confidential credentials (must never succeed; ensure no endpoint exposes them).

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Framework MUST provide a canonical top-level folder structure including (names may be adjusted for clarity while keeping purpose): `backend/`, `frontend/`, `shared/` (cross-cutting models/utilities), `infra/` (infrastructure & deployment descriptors), `scripts/` (automation), `tests/` (cross-layer or integration), `docs/` (high-level), and a root `README` referencing each area.
- **FR-002**: Framework MUST include per-area README stubs describing purpose, allowed contents, and placement rules.
- **FR-003**: Framework MUST supply environment configuration pattern (sample env file + documented precedence rules for local, staging, production) without embedding secrets in version control.
- **FR-004**: Framework MUST define a standardized error response model (fields for code, message (user-safe), correlation id, and timestamp) applied across backend endpoints.
- **FR-005**: Framework MUST provide a confidential client authentication abstraction where backend securely stores and uses client credentials to obtain access tokens and mediates issuance of frontend-safe session or access tokens.
- **FR-006**: Framework MUST strictly separate confidential material (server side only) from any artifacts delivered to the frontend build pipeline.
- **FR-007**: Framework MUST log security-relevant events (auth success/failure, token exchange, permission denial) using a structured format (key-value pairs) with correlation id propagation.
- **FR-008**: Framework MUST enforce least-privilege principle for backend-to-external-resource token scopes (only scopes explicitly configured are requested).
- **FR-009**: Framework MUST include baseline automated validation (script) that verifies folder presence, naming conventions, and absence of disallowed secret patterns in committed files.
- **FR-010**: Framework MUST provide a documented workflow for adding a new feature module covering backend route/controller, shared contract/type, frontend view/container, and test placeholders.
- **FR-011**: Framework MUST supply a pluggable authorization layer implementing roles plus fine-grained named permissions (roles map to sets of permissions) allowing endpoints to reference either role(s) or specific permission identifiers.
- **FR-012**: Framework MUST implement a token lifecycle with medium-lived access tokens (≈60 minutes) obtained via backend confidential client flow and silent re-acquisition performed server-side before expiry; no refresh token is exposed to the frontend.
- **FR-013**: Framework MUST adopt external identity provider federation (OIDC-like) as the primary user authentication method, deferring local credential storage; backend mediates the confidential client exchange and issues frontend-safe session tokens.
- **FR-014**: Framework MUST offer a mechanism to stub or mock identity provider interactions for local development without real credentials.
- **FR-015**: Framework MUST document security boundaries (what cannot be accessed from frontend, how secrets are loaded, rotation considerations).
- **FR-016**: Framework MUST include baseline accessibility and internationalization placeholders in the frontend (structure only; content not required now).
- **FR-017**: Framework MUST provide a contribution guide outlining code review expectations, naming patterns, and adding dependencies policy.
- **FR-018**: Framework MUST enable deterministic build & startup steps with a single documented command each for backend and frontend.
 - **FR-019**: Framework MUST define non-functional expectations with concrete baselines: backend cold start ≤ 8s, frontend dev build ready ≤ 45s, steady-state backend RSS memory ≤ 300MB (subject to review as features accrue).

### Key Entities

- **User**: Represents an end user interacting via the web frontend. Attributes (conceptual): identifier, display name, roles/permissions, status.
- **Session / Frontend Token**: Represents authenticated user context issued by backend after confidential client flow; contains claims permitted for frontend use (no secrets).
- **Confidential Client Credential**: Secure configuration item (client id + secret / key material) stored server-side only; used to obtain external access tokens.
- **Role / Permission**: Abstract authorization layer units controlling access to protected backend capabilities (granularity TBD—see clarification).
- **Audit Event**: Structured security/audit log record; includes event type, principal, timestamp, correlation id, outcome.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new developer can clone the repo and run both backend and frontend baseline processes successfully in under 10 minutes following only documented steps (observed across at least 2 trial runs).
- **SC-002**: Adding a new feature module scaffold (backend + frontend + tests + docs stubs) requires ≤ 15 minutes for a developer unfamiliar with internals (observed median across 3 trials).
- **SC-003**: Security audit of scaffold finds 0 occurrences of hard-coded secrets or confidential credentials in version-controlled files.
- **SC-004**: Unauthorized request to a protected endpoint receives a standardized error response 100% of the time in automated tests (no stack trace leakage).
- **SC-005**: Auth token acquisition success rate ≥ 99% under nominal conditions in a controlled test (simulated identity provider latency < 500ms) with graceful fallback defined for failures.
- **SC-006**: Structured log entries for auth-related events contain correlation id in 100% of sampled cases (sample size ≥ 50 events).
- **SC-007**: Documentation satisfaction (internal dev survey) ≥ 80% rating “clear or very clear” after first onboarding iteration.

## Authoritative State & Determinism (Constitution P1 & P3)

- Authoritative state touched/created: User records (conceptual), Session/Token metadata (ephemeral), Role/Permission definitions, Audit Event stream.
- Client inputs accepted: Authentication attempts (credentials or authorization codes/tokens), feature module creation requests (dev workflow), API calls with headers/parameters—each validated against schema: length bounds, allowed character sets, type conformity.
- Determinism considerations: Scaffold generation steps produce identical structure given same version/context; token issuance timing varies but logged deterministically with correlation ids. Any random identifiers must use a standardized generator enabling replay substitution.
- Replay harness updates needed: YES – need fixtures for auth event logs and token issuance simulation for deterministic replay in test harness.

## Observability & Performance (Constitution P4)

- New structured log events: AUTH_TOKEN_REQUESTED, AUTH_TOKEN_GRANTED, AUTH_TOKEN_DENIED, USER_SESSION_CREATED, USER_SESSION_EXPIRED, PERMISSION_DENIED, MODULE_SCAFFOLD_GENERATED.
- Metrics (counters/gauges/histograms): token_requests_total, token_request_latency, unauthorized_attempts_total, scaffold_generation_duration, active_sessions_gauge.
- Tick budget impact (estimate % at target load): <5% of processing budget allocated to auth scaffolding under baseline load (target justification documented for later tuning).
- Load test requirement: YES – confirm auth flow maintains ≥ 95% success within target latency under projected concurrent token request rate (define rate post-clarification on auth method).

## Security & Fair Play (Constitution P5)

- Input validation schemas: Conceptual schemas for auth payloads (username/password OR external assertion), configuration file schema, module naming pattern (regex) for scaffold generation.
- Anti-cheat / anomaly rules added or impacted: Brute force detection placeholder (threshold for failed auth attempts), token reuse detection for revoked sessions.
- Data integrity / migration notes: Initial framework creates no persistent domain tables beyond user & role abstractions (actual persistence handled later). Migration strategy doc placeholder included.
- PII considerations: YES – user identifiers and potentially names; ensure logging excludes sensitive credential material and masks user identifiers where not essential for audit.

## Assumptions

- Single-tenant environment initially; multi-tenant isolation can be layered later.
- External identity provider integration likely preferred (industry standard) but not enforced until clarification.
- Secrets managed outside VCS (environment variables, secret manager) – no in-repo secret storage.
- Frontend served separately from backend; shared contracts abstracted to avoid duplication.

## Open Clarifications (Max 3)

All previous clarification markers have been resolved (FR-011, FR-012, FR-013) per selections: Role model = roles + permissions; Token lifecycle = 60m medium-lived with silent backend renewal; Auth method = external identity provider federation.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-09

- Q: What baseline performance envelope do we want to lock in for the scaffold (cold start + dev build + memory) so FR-019 and success tracking are testable? → A: Option C (backend cold start ≤ 8s; frontend dev build ≤ 45s; backend RSS ≤ 300MB)

## Summary

The specification defines a foundational project framework enabling consistent, secure, and extensible development for both backend and frontend, centered on a confidential client authentication model. Three critical decisions remain for confirmation (role model depth, token lifecycle approach, primary user auth method). All other areas are specified with testable, measurable outcomes.
