# Specification Quality Checklist: Project Framework: Backend & Frontend Scaffold with Confidential Client Auth

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-10  
**Feature**: ../spec.md

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)  
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs  
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders  
- [x] All mandatory sections completed  

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain  
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous (except flagged clarifications)  
- [x] Success criteria are measurable  
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (some Colyseus mention â€“ acceptable given domain)  
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined for primary stories  
- [x] Edge cases are identified  
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded  
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified  

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance implications  
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows  
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria  
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification (framework names present)  

## Notes

Implementation detail leakage: References to Vite, Colyseus, PostgreSQL are present; retained intentionally due to foundational nature but could be abstracted if stricter stakeholder audience required.

Open clarifications intentionally limited to 3 per guidelines.
